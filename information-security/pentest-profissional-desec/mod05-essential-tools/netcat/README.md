# Netcat

Netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. Netcat is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool, since it can produce almost any kind of connection its user could need and has a number of built-in capabilities.

### Netcat helper:
```
$ nc -h

OpenBSD netcat (Debian patchlevel 1.105-7ubuntu1)
This is nc from the netcat-openbsd package. An alternative nc is available
in the netcat-traditional package.
usage: nc [-46bCDdhjklnrStUuvZz] [-I length] [-i interval] [-O length]
	  [-P proxy_username] [-p source_port] [-q seconds] [-s source]
	  [-T toskeyword] [-V rtable] [-w timeout] [-X proxy_protocol]
	  [-x proxy_address[:port]] [destination] [port]
	Command Summary:
		-4		Use IPv4
		-6		Use IPv6
		-b		Allow broadcast
		-C		Send CRLF as line-ending
		-D		Enable the debug socket option
		-d		Detach from stdin
		-h		This help text
		-I length	TCP receive buffer length
		-i secs		Delay interval for lines sent, ports scanned
		-j		Use jumbo frame
		-k		Keep inbound sockets open for multiple connects
		-l		Listen mode, for inbound connects
		-n		Suppress name/port resolutions
		-O length	TCP send buffer length
		-P proxyuser	Username for proxy authentication
		-p port		Specify local port for remote connects
        	-q secs		quit after EOF on stdin and delay of secs
		-r		Randomize remote ports
		-S		Enable the TCP MD5 signature option
		-s addr		Local source address
		-T toskeyword	Set IP Type of Service
		-t		Answer TELNET negotiation
		-U		Use UNIX domain socket
		-u		UDP mode
		-V rtable	Specify alternate routing table
		-v		Verbose
		-w secs		Timeout for connects and final net reads
		-X proto	Proxy protocol: "4", "5" (SOCKS) or "connect"
		-x addr[:port]	Specify proxy address and port
		-Z		DCCP mode
		-z		Zero-I/O mode [used for scanning]
	Port numbers can be individual or ranges: lo-hi [inclusive]

```

### Create a connection:

```
$ nc [host] [port]
```

* TCP connection:
```
$ nc 192.168.0.100 110
$ nc www.example.com 21
```

* UDP connection:
```
$ nc -u 192.168.0.100 110
$ nc -u www.example.com 21
```

### -v: Verbose mode
```
$ nc -v [host] [port]
$ nc -v 192.168.0.100 110
$ nc -v www.example.com 21
```

### -n: Suppress name/port resolutions
```
$ nc -vn [host] [port]
$ nc -vn 192.168.0.100 110
$ nc -vn www.example.com 21
```

### Open port (TCP/UDP):

```
$ nc [command] [port]
```

* Commands:
	* -v: verbose
	* -l: Listen mode, for inbound connects
	* -p: Specify local port for remote connects
	* -u: UDP mode

* TCP port:

```
$ nc -vlp 5050
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 5050)
```

* UDP port:

```
$ nc -vlpu 9000
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 5050)
```

### Windows nc (in Kali Linux machine)

```
$ locate nc.exe
/usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe
```

### Get info from user browser
Open 8080 port, and send a link for user connect:

```
$ nc -vlp 8080
```

* User connect (output)
```
Connection from [127.0.0.1] port 8080 [tcp/http-alt] accepted (family 2, sport 58242)
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080

```

### Show a message from file

```
$ echo "Offline" >> srv
$ nc -vlp 8080 < srv
```

* User connect (output)
```
$ nc 127.0.01 8080
Offline
```

### Share files

* Host that will receive the file
```
$ nc [command] [port] > [path/to/file]
$ nc -lnvp 5050 > Desktop/file.ext
```

* Host that will send the file
```
$ nc [command] [host] [port] < [path/to/file]
$ nc -vn 192.168.0.100 5050 < Desktop/file.ext
```
