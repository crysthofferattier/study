$ ssh user@linuxsvr.yourcompany.com

```

### Sumary
* If you have Â´physical access or if the Linux system is running in a VM, log in directly
* To log in over the network use SSH
* puTTy is a Windows SSH Client
* The command line utility ssh is used in Mac

## 3. Connecting Directly VM

### Take it easy
